# Project Overview

A full-stack Book Library Management System that allows users to register, log in, view and borrow books, while admins can manage the book catalog with complete CRUD functionality. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and styled using Tailwind CSS. Authentication is secured with JWT tokens, and role-based access controls differentiate between normal users and admins.
