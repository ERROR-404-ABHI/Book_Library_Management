#  Book Library Management System

##  Project Overview

A full-stack Book Library Management System that allows users to register, log in, view and borrow books, while admins can manage the book catalog with complete CRUD functionality.

Built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. Authentication is secured using **JWT tokens**, and **role-based access controls** differentiate between normal users and admins.

-Local MongoDB with Compass

-Real-world CRUD and relational data operations
```
### Commit Strategy

Every file was committed one-by-one with a meaningful message
( e.g., Add borrowController - handle borrow/return logic)

Avoided bulk commits (like git add .) to maintain traceability
```
